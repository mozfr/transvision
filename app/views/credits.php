<p>Transvision 1.0 was created by Philippe Dessante, former team leader for the French Mozilla localization team handled by the FrenchMozilla non-profit.</p>

<p>In 2012, FrenchMozilla localization activities were merged with the wider MozFR organization. As part of this process, Transvision maintenance and developments since 1.0 were transferred to MozFR and the application is currently maintained by Pascal Chevrel.</p>
