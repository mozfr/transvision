Transvision
===========

Transvision is a Web application targetting the Mozilla localization community created and maintained by the French Mozilla community (http://www.mozfr.org).

The main purpose of transvision is to be able to quickly find strings in Mozilla code repositories for Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey, Firefox OS and Chatzilla via a Web interface. There are also side-features such as checks for common typography errors for some languages, checks for the validity of localized access keys in the UI or comparizon views between Mozilla repositoru channels (Nightly/Aurora/Beta/Release)

Transvision is written in PHP, the string extraction is done with the Silme library (Python) and server install/maintenance scripts are in Bash.
